## Personal project JetBot

Always wanted to do something with my jetbot. I started with the basis from the offical repo  [JetBot documentation](https://jetbot.org)
(teleoperation, collisions avoidance,etc.). 

Now, I'm trying to see if I can integrate voice commands and other stuff 

The repo isn't representative of my current progress.
