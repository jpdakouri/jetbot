## Personal project JetBot

Always wanted to do something with my jetbot. I started with the basis from the offical repo  [JetBot documentation](https://jetbot.org)

Now, I'm trying to see if I can integrate voice commands, create a mobile app or something else.  

The repo isn't representative of my current progress. 

## Assembly (done)

(Nvidia hasn't updated the official repo for a while. Took me a few days to find the correct way to build the containers..)

## Video Teleoperation

## Next steps 

1. Further training for facial recognition and object avoidance 
2. Explore Amazon AWS Amplify to build an app and see how I could integrate it (maybe?)
